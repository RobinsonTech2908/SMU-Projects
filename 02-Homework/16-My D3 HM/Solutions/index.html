                    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
                    <p>When comparing the median age for a state with its percentage of smokers, it doesn't appear that there is a strong correlation between the two. The data points end up taking a cloud like shape where lower median age states are no more
                        likely to have a higher percentage of smokers than states with a higher median age.</p>

                    <p>One interesting observation is that the six states with the highest percentage of smokers all are located in what is commonly considered the southeastern part of the country. It would be interesting to see if the rest of the data showed
                        that these states also contain higher rates of poverty, obesity and lower healthcare rates.</p>

                    <p>Another observation is that the three highest populated states (CA, NY and TX) were among the five states with the lowest percentage of smokers. This is something that would require a lot more data to understand why, but it would be
                        interesting to find out if there is something that is driving this.</p>
